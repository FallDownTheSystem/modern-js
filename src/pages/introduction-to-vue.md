Let's do a little recap of everything we've learned so far.

We learned:
- Why JavaScript had a difficult start
- What new features modern JavaScript offers
- What new browser APIs we can take advantage of
- What modern application development looks like

But we still don't know how to *actually* build modern frontend JavaScript applications. We know the language features and the tools, so let's look at how frameworks can help us build applications. Specifically, let's look at Vue.

> Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

This isn't a tutorial for Vue; the documentation for Vue does a better job at that than I ever could. Instead, I want to talk about frontend JavaScript frameworks in more generic terms, but it helps to use Vue as an example.
