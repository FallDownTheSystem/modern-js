Now that we know what the tools for modern development are let's look at how frameworks can help us build applications. Specifically, let's look at Vue.

> Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

This isn't a tutorial for Vue; the documentation for Vue does a better job at that than I ever could. Instead, I want to talk about front-end JavaScript frameworks in more generic terms, but it helps to use Vue as an example.
