# Modern JavaScript Todo


## Section mechanic
- Smooth scroll (JS)
- Jump to the next heading or slide
- If the distance from the current position to the next jump is longer than 100vh, then jump distance / 100vh intervals (maybe a little less than 100vh)

## 404 layout


## Smaller screen support
- Two column and wide/wide-box media screen layouts
- Make the single column layout mobile friendly as well
- Hide side nav
